# DotNET
I worked 5 years with C#, but almost the time in game development with Unity Game Engine. But I believe my strong foundation help me to work with any dotNet technology easily. I wrote down what I got in the wiki

# PROJECTS
* Multi-threading with Task, Thread, Ansync
* WPF: this sample project was not developed with the best practice, because I just want to make rapid prototype for testing the WPF.
* MVC: simple project with ASP.NET and MySQL
